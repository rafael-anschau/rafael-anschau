- 👋 Hi, I’m @rafael-anschau
- 👀 I’m interested in solving complex and interesting problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solutions to problems that can not be solved by analogy(at least not completely) and require the invention of a
previously unknown solution(at least partially).
